# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-MLP-classifier-to-discern-facial-orientations-
The task is to build a classifier that can determine the orientation of an image of part of a face.
It must take a square region from a face image and report whether it is the right way up,
rotated 90-degree right, rotated 90-degree left or upside down. The square regions are of size
90, 50 or 30 pixels and are taken from original images of complete face that are 94 pixels
wide by 125 pixels high.
